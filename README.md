# Full-Stack-Dev-Program-Materials

This repo is to hold learning materials related to my learning of Full Stack Development with the goal of building a web app. The materials will be outlined in different Modules in chronological order, and will be based off of Front and Backend roadmaps, linked below. The functioning website will be published from the /docs folder inside this repo. I intend to start learning with Front end development and end with Back end development, see Table of Contents below.
